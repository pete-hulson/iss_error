# Abstract

# Introduction

Age and length composition data, critical components of integrated statistical fisheries stock assessment models [@QuinnDeriso1999], are prone to mulitple sources of error [@Pennington2002; @Hulson2012; @Stewart2014].
The concept of effective sample size [@Mcallister1997], a reduced sample size from the actual number of fish measured or aged, is implemented to account for increased uncertainty due to these measurement and observation errors. 
The effective sample size is used as the input sample size, or data weighting, used to describe the relative information content of the data products being integrated in the stock assessment (e.g., catch, survey biomass, size-at-age, composition). 
Due to the strong influence that compositional data can have in statistical catch-at-age assessment models, the weight assigned to these data products are important for providing accurate advice for management.

The input sample size assigned to annual composition data can follow a myriad of methods (e.g., fixed values as in @Monnahan2021, number of samples or tows sampled upon as in @Hulson2021 or @Spencer2022, bootstrapping compositions as in @Stewart2014).
The primary consideration when assigning a weight to composition data is to account for the potential variability and correlation in the sampling process. 
The method developed by @Stewart2014 allows for resampling techniques to be employed at each level of the sampling design, and provides an objective avenue to determine input sample size that is based on the observation variability contained within the sampling process.  
However, in addition to intra-haul correlation, there is additional variability in the ageing of otoliths, deamed 'ageing error' [e.g., @Punt2008] that has not previously been considered when determining input sample sizes.

There are a number of factors that can influence the magnitude of ageing error [@Nesslage2022], but inherent to obtaining ages from otoliths is variability in the age readings. 
To account for this source of variability, ageing laboratories regularly evaluate precision through obtaining multiple readings of the same otolith from different age readers [@Morison2005]. 
Several methods have been developed to account for ageing error in integrated fishery stock assessments when fitting age compositions through the use of an ageing error matrix [@Candy2012; @Punt2008]. 
The essence of this approach is that the numbers-at-age estimated by the assessment model are 'corrected' through multiplication with an ageing error matrix, which assigns estimated numbers-at-age to adjacent age-classes depending on the magnitude of the ageing error within the specific age-class. 
Since the development and implementation of ageing error matrices a number of studies have been devoted to quantifying the effects of ageing error on assessment model estimates [e.g., @Henriquez2016, @Liao2013]. 
Within each of these studies, and in each application of an ageing error matrix within a stock assessment model, the age composition data fit will be weighted by an input sample size. 
As described previously, the input sample size selected would reflect the variability in the sampling process, which would also include the variability in the age readings themselves. 

In the process of compositional expansion, it is often the case that an age-length key (ALK) is employed to expand population numbers-at-length to population numbers-at-age [@Ailloud2019]. 
It is through the age-length key, and the subsequent age expansion, that observations of age composition are derived from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent sources. 
Conditional age-at-length (CAAL), in which paired age-length data are used as an indication of the age distribution for a specific length, is used to inform length-at-age and it's related uncertainty [@Taylor2013]. 
CAAL data can be used directly within statistical catch-at-age models to inform estimates of growth as well as composition data [@Lee2019] and has been implemented in a number of operational stock assessments [e.g., @Mcgilliard2019; @Hulson2022]. 
An intrinsic component to both the ALK and CAAL is the variability in length for a given age.
Further, when using CAAL data as an additional likelihood component to a statistical catch-at-age model one must determine the input sample size to be used to weight this information.

Despite the acceptance of using an input sample size to weight composition data in integrated stock assessments to reflect the uncertainty caused by observation and measurement error inherent to sampling fish, and the recognition of the inherent variability in the ageing process when reading otoliths and in the growth process upon which age-length keys are based, these sources of uncertainty have not been previously integrated in an objective estimation method for input sample size. 
In this study we present, in a step-wise fashion, age composition input sample sizes that include both ageing error and growth variability for a number of species that reflect differing life histories and levels of ageing difficulty. 

# Methods

## Data
We used historical data collected from bottom trawl surveys conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) in the Eastern Bering Sea [EBS: @Lauth2019], Aleutian Islands [AI: @vonSzalay2017], and Gulf of Alaska [GOA: @vonSzalay2018]. 
Within the AFSC bottom trawl surveys both length frequency data and age specimen data are collected in addition to other survey data (e.g., catch, effort, location). 
Generally, a subsample of fish from each haul were processed at sea to collect their sex, length, and weight. 
A subsample of these fish have their sagittal otoliths collected, these otoliths were sent (with haul and specimen data) to the AFSC Age and Growth laboratory for age determination. 
Periodically, a subset of aged otoliths are selected for reader-tester agreement tests.
These tests are used to evaluate the reproducability of an age reading when two different readers age the same fish without knowledge of the other reader's age determination of the otolith [@Kimura1991]. 
The average annual bottom trawl survey age sample sizes by region, and the total number of otoliths used for reader-tester agreement tests are shown in Table \@ref(tab:species-samples)) for the species evaluated.
The species or stocks selected for this analysis all have greater than 5,000 reader-tester paired otolith readings.
These stocks are all assessed using integrated statistical stock assessment models that require input sample sizes for the age composition data. 
Details of how the length frequency and age collections are expanded to population abundance-at-length and -age then subsequently used as compositional data in stock assessment models at AFSC are provided in @Hulson2023b. 

## Simulation-Bootstrap framework
To evaluate the effect of the inclusion of ageing error and growth variability on uncertainty in age compostion datasets we modified a bootstrap-simulation framework [@Hulson - in review] to include these additional sources of error.
In simple terms, the simulation framework is a two-stage bootstrap that first resamples hauls, then resamples lengths and ages collected within the resampled hauls following from the methods in @Stewart2014. 
The simulation framework was modified to account for ageing error by resampling from tester ages associated with a given reader age. 
Growth variability was incorporated, for each species, by resampling fom all lengths associated with a given age and sex.

The order of operations (Figure \@ref(fig:bs-flows) has the following schedule:

1.  Resample hauls from the set of hauls with associated catch per unit effort (in numbers)
2.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed lengths
3.  With the resampled length frequency data from step 2, calculate population abundance-at-length
4.  Within the resampled hauls from step 1, resample the observed ages from the specimen data
5.  For the resampled ages in step 4, resample a length from the set of lengths observed for the given age
6.  For the resampled ages in step 4, resample an age from the set of tester ages for the given age
7.  With the resampled age data in steps 4-6 and the population abundance-at-length in step 3, calculate the population abundance-at-age

Steps 5 and 6 were designed to explore inclusion of ageing error and growth variability.
The bootstrap-simulation repeats steps 1-7 iteratively providing iterated population abundance-at-age for comparison to the historical (the full sample without any resampling of data) population abundance-at-age.

We applied the bootstrap-simulation in a step-wise manner to evaluate the consequences of adding each source of additional error to the age composition estimates across what we term 'uncertainty scenarios'.
First, we ran the bootstrap-simulation with the historical data without adding any extra error, thus, omitting steps 5 and 6 above ('Base' scenario). 
Next, we added ageing error ('AE' scenario) and growth variability ('GV' scenario) separately, thus, omitting either step 5 or 6 depending on the source of uncertainty desired.
Finally, we added both ageing error and growth variability ('AE & GV' scenario) to the bootstrap-simulation framework.
To increase reader-tester sample sizes for each species, we pooled reader-tester data across the three regions.
Sex-specific age-length pairs were pooled across all survey years, by region, in order to provide the maximum influence of growth variability on the replicated sex-specific age composition estimates.
The bootstrap-simulations were run for 500 iterations, a level at which the variability in population abundance-at-age results had stabilized.
The bootstrap-simulation was developed in R [@Rcore] and is available via GitHub as an R package (<https://github.com/BenWilliams-NOAA/surveyISS>).

## Computing effective and input sample size

A useful statistic that can quantify the variability in age composition is effective sample size, introduced by @Mcallister1997.
This statistic evaluates the amount of uncertainty in an estimated composition compared to an observed composition and is given by:

\begin{equation}
 ESS=\frac{\sum_{c=1}^{C}E_c(1-E_c)}{\sum_{c=1}^{C}(E_c-O_c)^2}
 (\#eq:eqn1)
\end{equation}
where $E_c$ is the estimated proportion for category-*c* (which can be age or any other arbitrary category across which proportions are computed) and $O_c$ is the observed proportion.
Here, the underlying age composition derived from the historical bottom trawl surveys with the full and unsampled data was treated as the observed proportions $O_c$ in equation \@ref(eq:eqn1).
For each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation we computed an estimated proportion ($E_c$) that was then compared to the underlying historical age composition ($O_c$) to determine the effective sample size of the resampled age composition.
Thus, across each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation we computed an effective sample size that indicated the amount of uncertainty in the resampled age composition.

The harmonic mean of the annual effective sample sizes was used to determine input sample sizes. 
The harmonic mean has been shown to reduce bias in recovering the true sample size in simulations of a multinomial distribution, and due to this reduction in bias the harmonic mean has also been recommended to determine the input sample size for compositional data [@Stewart2014].
Herein, when we use the term effective sample size we are referring to the effective sample sizes that were computed for each iteration of the bootstrap-simulation, when we use the term input sample size (ISS) we are referring to the harmonic mean of the iterated effective sample sizes.
Bootstrap-simulation results are presented graphically, in two forms, the estimated ISSs and the ISS relative to the Base scenario. 
The proportion of Base ISS is computed by dividing scenarios ISS by the Base ISS.

## Evaluating life-history relationships

Trends across stocks were aggreagted and evaluated using three species types: flatfish (arrowtooth flounder, flathead sole, northern rock sole, and yellowfin sole), gadids (walleye pollock and Pacific cod), and rockfish (Pacific ocean perch and northern rockfish).
We investigated the trends using the average coefficient of variation (CV) in age agreement and the average CV in age-length data.
These statistics were compared relative to the proportion of Base ISS.

# Results

While the magnitude of age composition ISS was stock and region specific, the general result was a reduction in age composition ISS as additional sources of uncertainty were introduced in the bootstrap procedure (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-plot)).
This reduction in age composition ISS resulted for both sex-specific and total (combined sex) age composition ISS.
The relative magnitude of adding ageing error compared to growth variability was also stock and region specific.
For example, adding ageing error to arrowtooth flounder age data resulted in smaller ISS than adding growth variability in the GOA, but larger ISS in the EBS.
Variability in the age composition ISS across the scenarios evaluated was also stock and region specific, with Pacific cod and walleye pollock in the EBS having the greatest reduction in ISS and AI Atka mackerel having the least.

The proportional reduction from the Base scenario ISS across uncertainty scenarios revealed patterns by species types and region (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-iss)).
Including ageing error for rockfish had a larger proportional reduction in ISS than including growth variability.
However, growth variability had a larger proportional reduction for flatfish and gadid ISS than adding ageing error.
Flatfish exhibited the greatest variability in the proportional reduction in ISS in any given region, while gadids had the largest reduction from Base ISS.
For example, after adding ageing error and growth variability the proportional reduction from the Base ISS for gadid was 85-95% in the AI, 40-50% in the EBS, and 70-80% in the GOA (Figure \@ref(fig:prop-iss)).
Overall, adding both ageing error and growth variability decreased the ISS to 50-90% of the Base ISS for flatfish, 40-90% for gadids, and 80-95% for rockfish.

The relationship between age composition ISS and the number of sampled hauls was not one-to-one for any of the species type evaluated (Figure \@ref(fig:iss-hls)).
Further, across uncertainty scenarios, there was large variability in the ISS compared to the number of sampled hauls for each species type evaluated, no clear pattern or trend was distinguishable.
While an increasing trend resulted for rockfish and flatfish between age composition ISS and the number of sample hauls when fitting a linear model to the data, it was generally the case that the age composition ISS was larger than the number of sampled hauls for hauls less than 100-200, and smaller than the number of hauls for hauls larger than 100-200. **Flag - May want to revisit some of this?** 
This increasing trend for rockfish and flatfish degraded as additional sources of uncertainty were added, but for each uncertainty case the trend was not one-to-one.
In each of the uncertainty scenarios investigated the trend between age composition ISS and the number of hauls for gadids was different than that for rockfish and flatfish, and while there was a slight increase in age composition ISS as the number of hauls increased, it was not as large of an increase as that which resulted for rockfish and flatfish.

A positive relationship is observed, by species group, between the number of age samples taken per haul and the age composition ISS per sampled haul (top panel of Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss-hls)).
However, as sources of uncertainty were added to age data this positive trend was dampened for each species type; this was particularly true for gadids as compared to flatfish and rockfish.
Across species types the age composition ISS per haul was around half of the number of sampled ages per haul, less for rockfish and gadids.
The age composition ISS per haul was, on average, the largest for flatfish, followed by rockfish, and was the smallest for gadids (bottom panel of Figure \@ref(fig:iss-nss-hls)).
The variability in the age composition ISS per haul across years, regions, and sex categories was also the largest for flatfish compared to gadids and rockfish.

Comparing between statistics for ageing error and growth variability resulted in different trends in the proportional reduction from Base ISS by species types (top panels of Figure \@ref(fig:ae-gv-stats)).
The proportional reduction from Base ISS when adding ageing error was similar when compared to the average reader-tester CV between gadids and rockfish, with lower variability for rockfish (top left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:ae-gv-stats)).
While the range in average reader-tester CV was smaller for rockfish and gadids than for flatfish, the resulting reduction from the Base ISS for larger for gadids than rockfish or flatfish.
The proportional reductions from the Base ISS when adding growth variability resulted in the smallest range in both ISS reduction and average age-length CV for rockfish, though flatfish and gadid had a larger CV spread (top right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:ae-gv-stats)).
On average, the proportional reduction from BASE ISS when adding both ageing error and growth variability was smallest for rockfish, intermediate for flatfish, and largest for gadids (bottom panel of Figure \@ref(fig:ae-gv-stats)).
The same trend resulted when evaluating the range in the proportional reductions from BASE ISS when both ageing error and growth variability were added.

# Discussion

In this study we find that accounting for ageing error and growth variability using bootstrap procedures decreased age composition ISS for all stocks examined.
The impact of the sources of uncertainty on resulting ISS was species type specific, with ageing error being more influential for rockfish than growth variability, and growth variability more influential than ageing error for flatfish and gadids.
We propose that these results are due to larger growth variability observed in gadids and flatfish compared to rockfish.
Further, the effects of ageing error are not unexpected for rockfish, as they are so long-lived. 
However, the average CV for reader-tester agreement was much larger for some flatfish stocks relative to the rockfish stocks evaluated, thus, there was some interaction between the number of age bins and ISS in this analysis.
When considering both ageing error and growth uncertainty the largest reduction in ISS magnitude was for gadids, followed by flatfish, with the least effect observed for rockfish, though results varies by stock and region.

Understanding effects of survey reduction effort has recently been the focus of a number of studies [@ICES2020; @ICES2023], as survey reductions may be inevitable in many regions.
A recent study investigated the reductions in length frequency and age collection effort, using AFSC bottom trawl survey as example [@Hulson2023c] and found that reduction in age collections had a larger effect on flatfish and rockfish as compared to gadids.
Here we find that including additional sources of uncertainty has largest effect on gadids, and smallest on rockfish, and it is potentially the case that the effect of decreases in sampling effort for gadids and flatfish would be smaller given the magnitude of effect by these sources of uncertainty as compared to rockfish.
However, we acknowledge that this should be evaluated in future studies to understand the specific effects on stocks and when comparing among species types.

It is well known that misspecification of ISS when fitting compositional data can lead to biased results in assessment model predictions [e.g., @Stewart2017; @Xu2020].
Here we show for gadids that there is upwards of a 50% decrease in ISS for some stocks when adding additional uncertainty as compared to the base case, an upwards of 40% decrease for flatfish, and an upwards of 20% decrease for rockfish.
Without these additional sources of uncertainty taken into account, using the bootstrap procedure would result in ISS that are inflated relative to their statistical power.
While we did not investigate implications to specific assessment model outcomes, it can be inferred that reductions of ISS on this scale would have downstream effects on model predictions and the associated uncertainty.
We note that these sources of uncertainty would not be contained only to fishery-independent sources but would also be inherent to age collections for fishery-dependent sources.
Thus, future investigations into the impacts of adding ageing error and growth variability into ISS estimation on assessment model results should also include fishery-dependent ISS implications as well.

A number of operational assessment models use hauls as a proxy in some form when setting ISS for age and length composition data [e.g., @Barbeaux2022, @Hulson2021].
This is derived from a result found in @Pennington2002 who investigated length frequency sampling and, based on the level of intra-haul correlation, determined that for the species that were investigated, on average, the ISS was one fish per haul
However, we note that the conclusion made in @Pennington2002 was not that the number of hauls should be used as a proxy for ISS in the assessment model data fitting procedure, but rather, that in order to potentially increase the ISS and have a better estimate of the level of intra-haul correlation that samples should be taken from an increased number of hauls.
This result was further substantiated in @Siskey2022, who also suggested that increasing the number of hauls while decreasing the sampling effort on any given haul was preferable to increasing the sampling effort within any given haul at the expense of sampling from a greater number of hauls.

In this study, we find that the relationship between age composition ISS and the number of hauls to be extremely weak, if non-existent.
While the magnitude of ISS and the number of sampled hauls is on a similar relative scale, there was not a one-to-one relationship for any of the stocks or species types evaluated.
Further, we found that there was extreme variability when comparing between the number of sampled hauls and the resulting bootstrapped ISS for all of the uncertainty scenarios investigated here, variability increased as the additional uncertainty sources were added to the bootstrap.
Compared to the bootstrap results, we found that if hauls were used as a proxy for ISS in an assessment model the ISS would be an underestimate if there were less than ~100 hauls sampled and an overestimate if more hauls were sampled.
It is the case that, based on the results of @Pennington2002, that sampling effort at AFSC has transitioned to sampling an increased number of hauls rather than increasing sampling in any given haul, thus, in recent time-series using hauls as a proxy for ISS is likely an over-estimate of ISS as compared to the bootstrap results.

There are several advantages to using the bootstrap procedure introduced here, that follows from @Stewart2014, to determine ISS for composition data used in stock assessment models.
The primary advantage is that this procedure accounts for the sampling design employed to collect data, and thus, implicitly includes the inter annual heterogeneity in sampling effort.
One could argue that the number of sampled hauls can be used as a proxy for this heterogeneity in sampling effort, and we would agree, but also add that the number of hauls itself does not account for the inter annual heterogeneity in intra-haul correlation, which can be large and based on the changes in population demographics (e.g., large recruitment events or changes in composition structure from year to year).
Thus, we recommend that the use of hauls as a proxy for ISS be discontinued when using stock assessment models to fit age and length composition data, and rather, assessment scientists consider implementing a bootstrap procedure as shown here to determine ISS.
As suggested in @Stewart2014, we agree that the bootstrap ISS can be used in a stock assessment model as the 'maximum' sample size.

Previous work has investigated both the inclusion of ageing error [@Punt2008; @Liao2013] and growth [@Taylor2013] within stock assessment models, however, none have applied these additional sources of uncertainty in the context of estimating ISS.
As it pertains to ageing error, in many current assessments an ageing error matrix is implemented [e.g., @Williams2022] in order to account for ageing error that is inherent to the age composition data.
Use of an ageing error matrix effectively 'smudges' assessment model estimates of population-at-age into adjacent age classes prior to fitting the 'observed' age composition input data from either fishery-independent or fishery-dependent sources.
Then, in the model fitting step, an ISS is used to fit the models 'smudged' estimates of age composition to the 'observed' age composition.
Here we argue that unless ageing error is accounted for in the age composition ISS used to fit these data then we are likely 'over-fitting' the model estimates to the 'observed' age composition and that the use of only an ageing error matrix half-way accounts for this source of uncertainty in the assessment modeling process.
The results from this study suggest that in some cases the addition of ageing error to the bootstrap method decreases the age composition ISS by 20-40%, thus, an ISS that does not take into account this source of uncertainty can be 125-165% too large.

It is commonly the case that age composition is produced through a two-stage expansion process [@QuinnDeriso1999], in which length frequency data is expanded to population-at-length in the first stage, and an ALK is used to expand population-at-length to population-at-age in the second stage [@Ailloud2019].
In the second-stage of this expansion process, the ALK is produced through the use of age-length paired data that are obtained in the age sampling collection, and within the ALK the variability in length-at-age is implicitly accounted for.
However, there have been no previous attempts to include this source of variability when considering the ISS that is used to fit the expanded age composition data.
We find that the magnitude of effect on age composition ISS is species type dependent, in which a larger effect results for species that exhibit larger variability in growth, for example, gadids and flatfish compared to rockfish.
When implementing growth variability there was a 10-50% decrease in the magnitude of bootstrapped age composition ISS, thus, if not taking this source of uncertainty into account the ISS can be up to 200% too large.

Overall, we find that including ageing error and growth variability when estimating age composition ISS can substantially reduce the ISS.
We provide three primary recommendations from this work.
First, we recommend that the use of hauls as a proxy for age or length composition ISS in stock assessment models be discontinued.
While we found that the scale of age composition ISS and hauls were similar, we did not find any relationship between the bootstrap ISS and hauls for any species that would suggest using hauls as a proxy, rather, we found that using hauls will likely lead to either an over- or under-estimation of ISS, with the former potentially having greater implications to model results [@Francis2011].
Second, we recommend that stock assessment scientists consider the use of bootstrap methods [a la @Stewart2017] to estimate age and length composition ISS.
With modern computing power, for a single species using contemporary R code it takes on order of a couple of hours to obtain both age and length composition bootstrap ISS for a historical survey time series (longer than 40 years in some cases); for a single year it is a matter of minutes.
Third, for all estimates of age composition ISS we recommend implementing ageing error and growth variability to more explicitly and thoroughly account for these sources of uncertainty.
We note that while we used fishery-independent data here as an example, that these sources of uncertainty are also inherent to fishery-dependent data.
